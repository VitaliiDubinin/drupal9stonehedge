# Stonehenge

![Stonehenge logo](logos/stonehenge_logo_wide.svg)

Local development environment toolset on Docker supporting multiple projects.

![Tests](https://github.com/druidfi/stonehenge/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

## What does it do?

Stonehenge aims to solve the basic problem for web developers: How to do development on local environment as easily as
possible.

Stonehenge provides you a shared development environment for multiple projects. It will handle the routing and local
domains for your projects as well as SSL certificates for those domains out of the box.

## Requirements for Stonehenge

- Latest macOS or Ubuntu LTS - [Read more](#supported-operating-systems)
- Make
- Docker 18.06.0+
- Docker Compose
- No other services listening port 80 or 443

## Requirements for a project

- `docker-compose.yml` file(s) - see [examples](#examples) how to use Stonehenge

## Stonehenge building blocks

- `andyshinn/dnsmasq` to route `*.docker.sh` to localhost
- `mailhog/mailhog` in [mailhog.docker.sh](https://mailhog.docker.sh) to catch emails
- `portainer/portainer` in [portainer.docker.sh](https://portainer.docker.sh) to manage your Docker (username: `admin`, password: `admin`)
- `traefik` in [traefik.docker.sh](https://traefik.docker.sh) to handle all traffic to containers
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) generated wildcard SSL certificate

## Setup

Note: in some systems setup will prompt once for your password as it will setup DNS.

### Oneliner

```
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/druidfi/stonehenge/2.x/install.sh)"
```

### Or manually with Git

```
$ git clone -b 2.x https://github.com/druidfi/stonehenge.git ~/stonehenge
$ cd ~/stonehenge
$ make up
```

### Using custom domain

You can also use custom domain instead of `docker.sh`:

```
$ make up DOCKER_DOMAIN=docker.druid.fi
```

Or alternatively change DOCKER_DOMAIN value in `.env` file.

## Stop or shutdown Stonehenge

Note: Stonehenge will be started on boot by default if not stopped before.

To stop Stonehenge:

```
$ make stop
```

Or totally to stop and remove Stonehenge:

```
$ make down
```

## Add alias

Add this line to your shell (bash, zsh, fish):

```
alias stonehenge='make -C ~/stonehenge'
```

Now you can run make targets from anywhere with the alias:

```
$ stonehenge up
```

## SSH keys

By default Stonehenge tries to add key from `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

You can add additional SSH keys with:

```
$ make addkey KEY=/path/to/mykey
```
